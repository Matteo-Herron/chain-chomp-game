October 19th:

Matteo:
-Made audio load much easier with audio::play_sound() by changing the definition of Macroquad in cargo.toml
-Shapes continuously move with held button, different controls for each shape
-Audio can be muted lol not really necessary just for fun
-Added code I found online to the end of Cargo.toml that makes everything load way faster (No idea how it works lol)
-Added background image last minute, haven't messed around with the parameters at all though


October 20th:

Sylvie:
-Restructured code a bit for readability and consistency
-Made file paths relative so they don't only work on Matteo's computer (lol)
-Used delta_time when calculating player movement so it doesn't depend on framerate
-Created Car struct to hold data for each player (position, size, speed, etc)
-Made cars circles so collision detection & physics will be much easier & better later on


October 26th:

Matteo:
I wanted to work on this all week :( I was lazy
-Fixed clamp to work for left and upper bounds (fixed mins)
-Implemented a collision check for our cars
    -On collision, colliding car is bounced back in the opposite direction, without rotating the texture
    -Problem! - If you time it right, you can get one circle inside of the other, and from there all hell breaks loose.
        -How can we stop the circle from entering the other circle, even if its just from the momentum of driving forward?
-Made reset function
-Loaded car sprite, for car2 we can use the same sprite and in draw_texture_ex we can change COLOR: to something new
-Added turning for car sprite in form of rotation(in radians fml)
    -I just want our car to face the direction we drive, right now its stuck in one of 4 directions, but can't go diagonal even if the circle doesn
-This all will probably change, I just wanted to mess around and test some stuff out


October 27th:

Matteo:
-Added prototype for friction/acceleration
    -This method for friction (kind of) addresses the collision problem from last update, it can still happen though
-I want the car to slow to a halt when you let go of the keys, couldn't get that to work, but got the check for no keys pressed working
-I used car1.vx for car1's acceleration, I think this isn't what you wanted to do with that variable Sylvie so I sorry and oops


October 28th:

Sylvie:
-Changed movement:
    -Cars now have a direction
    -Left/right keys turn the car
    -Up key moves the car in that direction, down key moves opposite that direction
-Added a little head to visualize the direciton the car is facing
-Modified acceleration/friction to work with this system
-Need to figure out how to implement a max speed with this system
-Collisions also don't work now, but we can work on that after we have movement working how we want it
-Changed changelog format to support both of us making changes in the same day

Sylvie:
-Fixed issues with delta_time
    -I didn't understand how it worked so I multiplied variables by it that I shouldn't have
-Added max speed, it worked once I fixed the delta_time issue
-Next we should work together to tweak acceleration, friction, max speed to make it feel right for our game
-Also the car currently drifts, we should decide if we don't want it to and if not implement that
-Then we can work on collision :D

October 29th:

Sylvie:
-Fixed the cars sticking to the screen borders
    -Now either the x or y velocity is reset to 0 if you hit a border

October 30th:

Sylvie & Matteo:
-Made the default movement not drifting, we can always add a button that makes you drift while holding it down
-Reformatted code to be more efficient
    -Now the code for each car's movement is only written out once

November:

Sylvie changed the turning and movement system so it works way better.

December 3rd:

Sylvie & Matteo:
-Added collision between cars and functionality for track collision

December 4th:

Sylvie:
-Added more track and walls

December 6th:

Sylvie:
-Finished basic outline of track with walls
-Added one curved section that we'll need to add collision for
-Also fixed various clippy warnings
-Might add some more shortcuts
-There are some boring sections of the track (bottom left) but I thought we could add obstacles there

December 9th

Sylvie & Matteo:
-Added animated sprites for the cars
-Added two separate sets of sprites, one for left facing and one for right facing
-It looks really good :D

December 10th

Matteo:
-Finished collision, arc bounces and collides on inner and outer borders.
-Added background gif to replace green texture, was thinking this could be like rainbow road lol
-Tried to delete duplicate gif frames by look, but it still looks a little rough.
-Changed colors of roads, looks kinda tacky I think we need track textures
IDK WHY THIS TOOK FOREVER AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

December 11th:

Matteo:
-Made and added pause menu 
-Made separate function to pause the game, drawing all graphics underneath
PROBLEM: Sprite counter updates more slowly in the function, causing the paused state to look slower
todo: fix problem
todo: get link to pause image for credit as well as chain chomp gif

December 16th:

Sylvie & Matteo:
-Added track sprites, still need sprite for curved track
-Added semi-functional main menu with sprites

December 17th:

Matteo:
- Finished main menu, exit, and start functionality
- If you look at the main menu loop for when Start is pressed, you'll see a variable "controls_timer"
    - Since moving to the controls screen and starting the game are the same button, if you click for too long
      it will automatically trigger the second if statement. So I added a variable that goes up by one and makes
      sure you don't accidentally skip that

- Why should u care? I was thinking for our race countdown timer, we could do a similar loop and say countdown = 0,
each iteration of the loop adds .01 to countdown and if countdown % 3 is a whole number (3, 2, 1, 0), draw text displaying countdown,
and if countdown % 3 = 0 start the race.

- I am too tired to do this rn lmfao maybe later though

-We still have to fix December 11 problems

December 17th (again)

Matteo:
- Finished and added a countdown to start each race
- Laps are counted and after 3 laps you win with a big screen
    - Laps cannot be cheesed and you must update your ability to add a lap by driving through the block after the arc.
- Added new font and various texts around, various textures for goaltape and countdown and others

-Still haven't finished December 11 problems

December 18th:

Matteo & Sylvie:
-other changes lol gonna add them here later
-Matteo: FINISH THE CONTROL SPRITES OR WHATEVER
